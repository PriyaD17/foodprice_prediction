# **BigBasket Product Price Prediction**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to scrape product data from **BigBasket** and build a **Machine Learning model** to predict product prices based on various attributes. The project involves **web scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling** using **scikit-learn**.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **BeautifulSoup** (for Web Scraping)  
- **pandas, numpy** (for Data Processing)  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** (for Data Visualization)  
- **scikit-learn** (for Machine Learning)  

---

## **Data Collection**  
Data was collected using **web scraping** from BigBasketâ€™s website.  

### **Scraped Attributes:**  
- Product Name  
- Brand   
- Price  

## **Algorithm Used**
- Linear Regression
---
  ## **Future Improvements**  
- **Scrape more product attributes** (discounts, ratings, stock availability).  
- **Use advanced NLP techniques** (**Word2Vec**) instead of **Label Encoding** for text features.  
- **Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning** for better accuracy.
